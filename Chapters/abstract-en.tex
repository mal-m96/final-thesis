Regardless of the language in which the dissertation is written, a summary is required in the same language as the main text and another summary in another language. It is assumed that the two languages in question are Portuguese and English.

The abstracts should appear first in the language of the main text and then in the other language. For example, if the dissertation is written in Portuguese the abstract in Portuguese will appear first, then the abstract in English, followed by the main text in Portuguese. If the dissertation is written in English, the abstract in English will appear first, then the abstract in Portuguese, followed by the main text in English. 

In the \LaTeX\ version, the NOVAthesis template will automatically order the two abstracts taking into account the language of the main text. You may change this behaviour by adding
\begin{verbatim}
    \abstractorder(<MAIN_LANG>):={<LANG_1>,...,<LANG_N>}
\end{verbatim}
\noindent to the customization area in the document preamble, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
    \abstractorder(de):={de,en,it}
\end{verbatim}

The abstracts should not exceed one page and, in a generic way, should answer the following questions (it is essential to adapt to the usual practices of your scientific area):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the problem?
  \item Why is this problem interesting/challenging?
  \item What is the proposed approach/solution?
  \item What results (implications/consequences) from the solution?
\end{enumerate}

%Feature selection methods for cancer classification are aimed to overcome the high dimensionality of the biomedical data which is a challenging task. Most of the feature selection methods based on DNA methylation are time consuming during testing phase to identify the best pertinent features subset that are relevant to accurate prediction. However, the hybridization between feature selection and extraction methods will bring a method that is far fast than only feature selection method. This paper proposes a framework based on both novel feature selection methods that employ statistical variation, standard deviation and entropy, along with extraction methods to predict cancer using three new features, namely, Hypomethylation, Midmethylation and Hypermethylation. These new features represent the average methylation density of the corresponding three regions. The three features are extracted from the selected features based on the analysis of the methylation behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated by the breast cancer classification accuracy. The results give 98.85% accuracy using only three features out of 485,577 features. This result proves the capability of the proposed approach for breast cancer diagnosis and confirms that feature selection and extraction methods are critical for practical implementation.
